### About
Java developers often face the need to store and process data conveniently. The Java Collections Framework can help with this issue, as developers usually don't need to create new collections from scratch â€“ they only need to apply or slightly extend the existing ones to solve their needs.

However, there are some design drawbacks inherited in the Java Collections Framework, which can even lead to bugs in your programs. Some approaches used in this library are considered obsolete now and are normally avoided in modern libraries.

Besides, sometimes developers face rare issues, for which the standard collections aren't enough. In such cases, alternative libraries such as Google Guava Collections or Apache Common Collections may help. These libraries contain more collections and an abundance of auxiliary algorithms to work with. Another solution is to write your problem-specific collections. This is much more complicated and not always the best solution, but it isn't forbidden either.

### Stages
- Immutable Collections
- BiMaps and MultiSets
- Size Limited Queues
- Ranges
